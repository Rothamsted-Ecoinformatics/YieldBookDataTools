94/R/BK/1|BROADBALK| To study the effects of organic and inorganic manures on continuous w. wheat. From 1968 two three-year rotations were included: potatoes, beans, w. wheat and fallow, w. wheat, w. wheat.  In 1979 the first retation was changed to fallow, potatoes, w. wheat. In 1980 the second rotation reverted to continuous w. wheat. Since 1985 part of the second rotation has been added to the first to extend the rotation to fallow, potatoes, w. wheat, w. wheat, w. wheat.  The 151st year, w. wheat, fallow, potatoes.  For previous years see ‘Details' 1967 and 1973, Station Report for 1966, pp. 229-231, Station Report for 1968, Part 2, Station Report for 1982, Part 2, pp. 5-44 and 74-93/R/BK/1. |||  Wheat: Section a 0.00351 1 0.00645 2,3,5 and 6 0.00533 9 0.00561 Potatoes: 7 0.00348
